CHANGELOG
=========

v0.0.3 (2017-11-22):
	Changes:

	* Listen on `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1` to facilitate running the
	  server inside a Docker container.

v0.0.2 (2017-11-17):
	Fixes:

	* When a Jenkins build finished and Kipper finished polling, the final
	  GitHub status would be set as "pending" instead of "success" or
	  "failure". It now sends the correct status.
	* It was possible for Kipper to request Jenkins before a job
	  corresponding to the latest code in the pull request had been created.
	  An initial delay of 30 seconds is added before Kipper contacts Jenkins
	  to give it time to warm up.
	* Send the Jenkins job console URL instead of the job index URL with the
	  GitHub commit status request. Now, clicking on the status icon in
	  GitHub opens the console page so the build log is visible immediately.
	* Miscellaneous code refinements.

v0.0.1 (2017-11-13):
	* Initial release.
